It helped my son who has austim to relax at night. He loved it until he pulled the light box and wires out .
Brilliant worth getting for children. My son loves it. Needs to change baterry especially occasionly but is wonderful pillow and very soft thought.
It is a lovely cushion and lights up gorgeous. I will be purchasing another. It would have git five stars but unfortunately the battery area was undone. The cotton having come away and the box it  in was crumpled. I think I received an item that was once returned.
Smaller than I thought but fantastic all the same.. Would buy more
As expected
My Daughter in law was disappointed with it
Worked for a day then died and wen I changed the batteries it doesn't work still!
we love it to use it in a dark den, but I just wish the compartment with batteries could have a soft pouch to be hidden, as you can feel it when touching it
My 5 nearly 6yr old son who has SPD absolutely adores this pillow he loves the colours plus the soft fluffy material. Only downfall is it's pure white in Colour and not washable but he takes extra care with it and it has kept its Colour. Would def reccomend purchasing it.
great
It broke and wires were not attached as came loose. Only had a month or so. Seller does not responded to emails. Very disappointed.
Item didnt light up but my son loved the feel of it and wouldnt let me send it back
This is great for anyone suffering with PTSD and they want to self sooth. It's brilliant as a nightlight as it's not too bright and it's really soft when snuggling on it. Very pleased with it
purchased as a gift and was greatly appreciated by the recipient. pillow doesn't look exactly the same as the picture when lit but is still very effective.
My son loved them, perfect, calm and soft. Only thing I thought they would be bigger
Bought it for great grandson but great granddaughter took over as she liked the most
works great
Great Product thank you for the replacement pillow
Fantastic I love it x
Excellent product ,,brought this for my autistic granddaughter she absolutely loves it....ðŸ˜Š
Fantastic present for my autistic child.
Really good. Quick delivery
Brilliant
To be  honest my gripe is the amount of fluff that comes off the cushion. Its like having a moulting dog. I bought 2, and though my sons like them they were forever sneezing and picking fluff off their face.You will need a good hoover.
Great product, soft to soft. My son loves it
Actually bought this for a guy who has autism as part of his sensory items. The cushion is lovely and soft. And the lights are very gentle and no flashing brightly. It takes 3 AA batteries.  It has gentle colour change overs a nice range of colours. Also multi coloured . I haven't tested the colours in the dark but they look good so far
Not too good
A very good idea and my granddaughter loves it but only had a short while and it has broke, nylon zip has come apart and battery box kept falling out and wires came out so now doesn't work. Such a shame as it really comforted my 10yr autistic granddaughter.
Lovely goid buy
I bought this for my autistic grandson, it helps to calm him when he is sressed, and he loves it
My autistic son loved this.
Bought for a family member who has autism. Great feel and lighting, safe too.
love it
Great pillow. Really soft and the lights are not too bright. Only thing is drains the batteries very quickly
My grandson, who is complex needs, is simply delighted with his pillow.Thank you, it was the perfect birthday gift
Thought this was s waste of money  the lights are very small and it's not sensible to he white as it gets dirty very quickly  and difficult to wash would  not recommend this for anyone with sensory needs
I bought this cushion for my grandson's 5th birthday and he loves it
I was a bit eerie about buying this, but I took the plunge based on other reviews. It arrived pretty quickly, but the box appeared to be opened. It wasn't a huge concern for me, but it does go into consideration if you want to buy it as a gift. It runs off 3 x AA batteries. The battery box is said into the pillow. You can feel it if you squeeze it, but it's not a large box so it's easy to miss, thankfully. The lights are soothing and do help to create a relaxing atmosphere. The pillow itself is really soft and amazing on its own. I have no complaints with it. One thing to consider is that the wires are really thin and don't look like they can take a lot of wear-and-tear. It shouldn't be an issue hugely as they're inside, but care may be required when replacing the batteries.
Great gift
Beautiful cushion. My 11 year old daughter loves it. She sleeps with it on at night. A good buy. Would recommend it.
My Austim grandson loves it
bought as a christmas present for my daughter, absolutely loves it.
Grand daughter loves it
Would be even better if it was not so white or a protected cover
Ideal for special needs
Perfect.
My grandson will love this cushion. It feels soft and it light up. It's good in the dark
Lovely and it does sooth!Doesn't use too much power either despite needing so many batteries!
I bought this as a present for my 4 year old and he loved it. I then bought one for my 16 year old to give to a friend for Xmas - and she loved it. I would just say handle the battery compartment with care - be gentle when taking it out. It's really pretty and really fluffy and we would recommend it for anyone who likes pretty lights.
Looked nice when activated but did not look as good as the photo advertising the product.
In light this pillow for my autistic nephew and he loves it, it's nice and soft and the lights are very stimulating for him.
This is really lovely pillow
Avoid this product no matter who is selling it. It is a white cushion with an ombr&eacute; of spots of light
My son us is on the spectrum & he lives this pillow so soft even I wanted it
Perfect gift for a friend. Really pretty in the dark, lights up bright and changes colour. Really happy with it. Fast delivery.
Nice item
My autistic son loves this cushion and the calming colour changes.
Exactly as described . Well made
My autistic granddaughter absolutely adores this cushion! She refuses to go to bed without it. It's soft & cuddly & the colours are lovely. Well done. Nan a was a big hit because of this present.
This product caught my eye right away.Came the next day, all in one piece and was better than I expected.The pillow is actually quite big compared to what I thought. Well worth the money and a great present for a light loving friend!Sets the mood wonderfully - 10/10
cool
Lovely sensory toy
Bought as part of Christmas present.Arrived on time and I am really pleased with this product.I am sure they will be well receivedProduc as described
Nice Little Pillow, We Use it as A Night Light In Our Babys Cot. Its a plain white pillow with changing L.E.D's Inside.
Lovely looking gift Bought as a present
My son is going to love this!
Fast delivery but smaller than picture shows dispointed ðŸ˜ž
Lovely plush cushion, gentle colours, better in a dark room / area
Prompt service. Brilliant product.
PRESENT and its fne
Love this great purchase my son will love it
Looks great and daughter loves it.
The lights don't work
For a product that's supposed to relieve stress, opening the battery case achieved the opposite. The plastic box has a tiny screw for which you need an extremely delicate screwdriver. Why not have an easy to open clip or slide? That makes no sense. Elderly people would find this impossible to open. We did it, and the end result was distinctly average with fewer lights than expected, and on one side only - and you can feel them through the material. The lights go off automatically after 15 minutes. Yet to see if it calms us down.
Bought this for my Autistic grandson as a stocking filler we know he will love it
Visual impairment child loved this. thank you
Super soft. Claiming lights. Only bright on one side though and has no auto shut off
Not so bad.
good product
Birthday present for my friends son 9 year's old who is autistic.  He loved it. Quick delivery.
Item didn't work I havent received a replacement item or returns details.
A soft cozy pillow that lights up in the dark. My 5 year old nephew who suffers with sensory processing love it- was a perfect calming gift for him :)
Nice decent pillow, light are pretty bright too :)
I ordered this and received a laptop cushion not amused! Very disappointed!
My Daughter loved it even before my Granddaughter saw it!!!!!
Bought this for a child aged 3 with SPD. Great quality and well received gift.
little girl loves it and goes to sleep with its help.
Really impressed with both light and quality texture of the pillow
My autistic son loves this pillow it's soft and the colours and gentle changes are impressive. Worth every penny and still going strong after many months of ruff and tumble.
My two year old little girl loves going to bed with this pillow however we always ensure its switched off and removed from her bed when she falls asleep. Only gave this a three because they are very easily damaged. Despite the electrics being internally protected by the pillow itself the quality isn't great and we've had two brake now.
The wire leading to the colour changing box came out , was unable to repair so there was no colour changing light at all, my grandaughter who is five was confused as she is autistic and kept taking the battery box out so I had to cut the second wire to remove the battery box for safety reasons.she still likes to cuddle it in bed but I was disapointed in it.She was born minus her ears therefore she is also deaf and particularly loves all pretty colours.
The cushion has helped my preschooler fall asleep at night for the first time ever on his own!it feels so soft and the glow is really subtle and calming.the only downside is its very easy for inquisitive fingers to open the zip and get at the mechanisms
my autistic cousin loved it
my daughter loves it
Our little girl loves this and it was delivered super quick in time for Christmas
Item was exactly how it was stated, arrived earlier than date so was very happy, my son loves it. Thank you
I have had this a month now. My son uses it every night. However, it was fantastic for about a week. Now only the red lights up, is very dim and I have to manually switch it off. New batteries make no difference. Very disappointed.
my son loved this when he got it but broke after a week. my son has autism and was very upset
Work for a day, and that's it. I won't recommend
Lasted about 2 weeks until the power unit inside broke apart. Avoid if you want it to last.
Perfect
Brought this for my daughter for Christmas just as a stocking filler. She plays with it more then the Â£50 doll she asked Santa for! Had a few tears about being scared of the dark before christmas;  not now she has her pillow! Has changed bedtime to a calm and happy time again. Wonderful product!
Got this for my girlfriend and it feels amazing! It doesn't heat up, so no worries there, and it's extremely relaxing.
A++ Great purchase. Speedy delivery. Great for kids AND adults. Our African albino pygmy hedgehog is just CRAZY about this illuminated cushion.
Bit more brighter than the picture, also u need to only sponge clean the cushion.
My special needs daughter loves this. Very relaxing.
Daughter  live it colour are nice too
grandchildren loved them
Poor quality , ordered 2 , one did not work . The cushions. Did not look like the photo. ,  that showed what they did look like when lit up .  Very disappointing. . I am sending them back ,
Great little present.
Our daughter loved her colour changing pillow its great and lovely and soft
This is for a autistic child so hopefully will help him relax when he goes to bed
Absolutely pleased with this item,,  I bought it for my granddaughter who has seen sensory needs and she loves it,  it cuddles it tightly as it's so soft
The product came, the box looked like it had already been opened and bashed around. Took the cushion out and placed batteries in it to find it does not work at all - the cushion is nice however could have been bought for Â£1 at a local shop. Not what I expected at all very disappointed
VERY HAPPY WIFE, SHE LOVES THE CUSHION,  Dave Smith
Nice idea.
Cute wee pillow
I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely nothing loves it. It helps her sleep at night and the light turns off after a while itself .Well worth it
Poor
Battery holder could do with some padding. It was good for the first week or so, then the wiring for the switch came off, I cut open the pillow to resolder, That did the trick. a month later the switch fell apart inside the pillow,  I put in another switch then a short time later some of the little wiring going to the LED's had issues. Now its just a fully pillow that doesn't light up.This item is not made for hard wearing places like kids beds. Suggest only be bought by adults for adults.
Good pillow- my daughter loves it - fast delivery
this item arrived before the date stated so was very quick delivery. It is a great gift for children and would buy it again
These item made a person with sensory difficultie very happy recoomend this seller.
great gift
My daughter loves this pillow, it is so so soft and the lights are lovely.
Prompt delivery exactly what it says in the description
Great thanks
Brought this for teenage daughter. Works well is very soft and mood lighting is very effective. Would buy again
great pillow daughter loves it.
great
excellent, would recomend
Ok but not as many lights as the photo
From the picture on the box this product looks fantastic but in reality it is something from The Fairground you win on the stalls.Talk about false advertising and tricking people. Once the batteries were in and light was out, the word pathetic comes to mind.Traffic lights are more amusing to watch change colours and they are better illuminated. Unless l had a faulty one which l dont think so as it was working, the best thing about this product is the box as at least the colours look good on the box unlike the product.
realy good
Arrived quickly but the actual cushions looked quite cheap and the boxes were a bit tatty, however saying thay my niece and nephew loved them and as far as I am aware they are still working fine!
My 10 year old son loves this as he hates the dark so very handy at night but only it doesn't do is switch itself off
Bought for Christmas present my friend loves it so far not had any bad feedback will be buying myself one soon
pillow never worked at all, very poor product.
Makes a good value Christmas present
iteam arrived later than stated but the pillow itself is awesome. Soft and the colours do sooth you in some strange way.
Item as described
IT IS NOT WORKING !!!
Had it only a week and the lights stopped working
Arrived promptly. It's snugly and the lights are a lovely feature for children scared of the dark. X
Very pretty pillow
A xmas present so cool
Unfortunately i have to join the group of users that were disappointed by this product.The cushion is very fluffy and soft but the fist one I got worked 2 times 5min and that was it.I got a replacement and that 2nd cushion lasted 10min. Very disappointed.In both trials I changed the batteries but it didn't help and I couldn't see any damage with the wiring like other customers describe.I now got a refund so, the company is really easy to deal with. The product is a good idea but it is a shame that its quality is so poor.
Great product. Super soft and bright lights. it's justa shame our first one stopped working after the 5th time it was used :(
Was already broken the 2nd day after we unwrapped it. My 9 year old son and me where very dissapointed. Rubbish.
Excellent!!Received in VERY GOOD TIME (as kindly requested)!AS DESCRIBED. ALHAMD lilaah! Very GoodThis was a PERFECT GIFT
Bought this as a Christmas present for my Grandson and was so disappointed as it  did not work. Electronics are very cheap looking. Will need to return this.
Cant say anything bad about this product. Super soft and easy to use. Just put batteries in pack, hide in the cushion and zip it up. Has an on off button on the front. Very bright when you are in a dimly lit room, it is lovely. My autistic brother is gong to love it!!!! Very good size too.
Bought as a Christmas present. Lovely quality, its works and it arrived promptly - so overall pleased
Plain white cushion, so may get a little grubby after a while. The lights are nice and relaxing, though.
Was great , but didn't last long , wires broke very easy
Very poor. Doesnt light up like in the picture and stopped working very quickly.
Received this pillow and does not work! Received a replacement and neither did that one!!
Very poor after the first week one of the wire broke which I fixed now the switch does not work on the outside of the pillow very sad for 6 year old
Opened on Christmas Day, broken by Boxing Day! Not a good product
Really needs to come with a removable washable cover
A1 Awesome :)
Brilliant, only drawback is unable to wash cover.
Make sure you have rechargeable batteries, our son loves it and the brightness is perfect when going to bed.Great buy
Bought 2 of these for my nieces they love them
Very fast delivery and excellent quality ... My daughter loves it!
Cushion arrived looks good , but after a week lights have gone out
Got this for my daughter, lovely soothing lights and soft pillow, will not sleep without it now.
Rubbish!
I think I must have been sold a previously returned item.  Pillow was not in a plastic protective cover as should have been plus one side of pillow only 2 small colours light up.  Had my son not seen seen it, by accident, I would have returned it.  And it is not a pillow it is a cushion.
I ordered, and received, two of these a few weeks ago. One pillow doesn't work and after my review I was issed a full refund. Excellent customer service.  I can now buy one to replace the broken one! The pillow that does work is lovely. It's soft and the colours are so pretty and soothing.
Very pleased
Bought 2 of these for my son and daughter for Christmas so not used yet.  However I did put my hand in the box and cushion feels lovely and soft.  Looking forward to using them.
I love this cushion! So soft and glowing with soothing lights. Now I need another for my little guy!
Zip broke off after a few days!! Quite disappointing!
love it
Excellent item and excellent service came before Christmas which I didn't expect, so I very happy customer
Lights broke after 10 mins, cheap terrible product
Didn't last a week and it broke ,shame as it was to help my autistic daughter.
brilliant idea grandma loved it
excellent value in all ways - a great buy
Arrived in good time. feels soft. its lights are not that brite
Perfect, very happy
Soft, very soothing and comfortable. The lights are just right and give a wonderful effect to a darkened room. Bought 4 as gifts and everyone said how lovely they were.
The first pillow arrived in good time but did not work. I returned it and had to wait two weeks for another one to arrive. Upon arrival I attempted to load new batteries. However, the battery cover has a short zip and the zip slider came off upon first opening rendering the pillow unusable. I have returned this pillow also and am still waiting for a full refund as at 13/12/2013
