It arrived pretty quickly, but the box appeared to be opened. It wasn't a huge concern for me, but it does go into consideration if you want to buy it as a gift. It runs off 3 x AA batteries. The battery box is said into the pillow. You can feel it if you squeeze it, but it's not a large box so it's easy to miss, thankfully. The lights are soothing and do help to create a relaxing atmosphere. The pillow itself is really soft and amazing on its own. I have no complaints with it. One thing to consider is that the wires are really thin and don't look like they can take a lot of wear-and-tear. It shouldn't be an issue hugely as they're inside, but care may be required when replacing the batteries.","Asin":"8329002071"},{"Id":"R4G951PK1H06E","Rating":5.0,"Title":"Five Stars","Author":"Amazon Customer","Content":"Great gift","Asin":"8329002071"},{"Id":"R34SZ6BA6JSIJM","Rating":5.0,"Title":"Beautiful cushion.
