It helped my son who has austim to relax at night. He loved it until he pulled the light box and wires out .
Brilliant worth getting for children. My son loves it. Needs to change baterry especially occasionly but is wonderful pillow and very soft thought.
Smaller than I thought but fantastic all the same.. Would buy more
As expected
we love it to use it in a dark den, but I just wish the compartment with batteries could have a soft pouch to be hidden, as you can feel it when touching it
My 5 nearly 6yr old son who has SPD absolutely adores this pillow he loves the colours plus the soft fluffy material. Only downfall is it's pure white in Colour and not washable but he takes extra care with it and it has kept its Colour. Would def reccomend purchasing it.
great
This is great for anyone suffering with PTSD and they want to self sooth. It's brilliant as a nightlight as it's not too bright and it's really soft when snuggling on it. Very pleased with it
purchased as a gift and was greatly appreciated by the recipient. pillow doesn't look exactly the same as the picture when lit but is still very effective.
My son loved them, perfect, calm and soft. Only thing I thought they would be bigger
Bought it for great grandson but great granddaughter took over as she liked the most
works great
Great Product thank you for the replacement pillow
Fantastic I love it x
Excellent product ,,brought this for my autistic granddaughter she absolutely loves it....ðŸ˜Š
Fantastic present for my autistic child.
Really good. Quick delivery
Brilliant
Great product, soft to soft. My son loves it
Actually bought this for a guy who has autism as part of his sensory items. The cushion is lovely and soft. And the lights are very gentle and no flashing brightly. It takes 3 AA batteries.  It has gentle colour change overs a nice range of colours. Also multi coloured . I haven't tested the colours in the dark but they look good so far
Lovely goid buy
I bought this for my autistic grandson, it helps to calm him when he is sressed, and he loves it
My autistic son loved this.
Bought for a family member who has autism. Great feel and lighting, safe too.
love it
Great pillow. Really soft and the lights are not too bright. Only thing is drains the batteries very quickly
My grandson, who is complex needs, is simply delighted with his pillow.Thank you, it was the perfect birthday gift
I bought this cushion for my grandson's 5th birthday and he loves it
I was a bit eerie about buying this, but I took the plunge based on other reviews. It arrived pretty quickly, but the box appeared to be opened. It wasn't a huge concern for me, but it does go into consideration if you want to buy it as a gift. It runs off 3 x AA batteries. The battery box is said into the pillow. You can feel it if you squeeze it, but it's not a large box so it's easy to miss, thankfully. The lights are soothing and do help to create a relaxing atmosphere. The pillow itself is really soft and amazing on its own. I have no complaints with it. One thing to consider is that the wires are really thin and don't look like they can take a lot of wear-and-tear. It shouldn't be an issue hugely as they're inside, but care may be required when replacing the batteries.
Great gift
Beautiful cushion. My 11 year old daughter loves it. She sleeps with it on at night. A good buy. Would recommend it.
My Austim grandson loves it
bought as a christmas present for my daughter, absolutely loves it.
Grand daughter loves it
Would be even better if it was not so white or a protected cover
Ideal for special needs
Perfect.
My grandson will love this cushion. It feels soft and it light up. It's good in the dark
I bought this as a present for my 4 year old and he loved it. I then bought one for my 16 year old to give to a friend for Xmas - and she loved it. I would just say handle the battery compartment with care - be gentle when taking it out. It's really pretty and really fluffy and we would recommend it for anyone who likes pretty lights.
Looked nice when activated but did not look as good as the photo advertising the product.
In light this pillow for my autistic nephew and he loves it, it's nice and soft and the lights are very stimulating for him.
This is really lovely pillow
My son us is on the spectrum & he lives this pillow so soft even I wanted it
Perfect gift for a friend. Really pretty in the dark, lights up bright and changes colour. Really happy with it. Fast delivery.

This product caught my eye right away.Came the next day, all in one piece and was better than I expected.The pillow is actually quite big compared to what I thought. Well worth the money and a great present for a light loving friend!Sets the mood wonderfully - 10/10

Really impressed with both light and quality texture of the pillow
My autistic son loves this pillow it's soft and the colours and gentle changes are impressive. Worth every penny and still going strong after many months of ruff and tumble.
The cushion has helped my preschooler fall asleep at night for the first time ever on his own!it feels so soft and the glow is really subtle and calming.the only downside is its very easy for inquisitive fingers to open the zip and get at the mechanisms

Plain white cushion, so may get a little grubby after a while. The lights are nice and relaxing, though.
Really needs to come with a removable washable cover

Got this for my daughter, lovely soothing lights and soft pillow, will not sleep without it now.
I ordered, and received, two of these a few weeks ago. One pillow doesn't work and after my review I was issed a full refund. Excellent customer service.  I can now buy one to replace the broken one! The pillow that does work is lovely. It's soft and the colours are so pretty and soothing.
Very pleased
