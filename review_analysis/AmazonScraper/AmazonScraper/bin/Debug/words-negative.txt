Worked for a day then died and wen I changed the batteries it doesn't work still!
It broke and wires were not attached as came loose. Only had a month or so. Seller does not responded to emails. Very disappointed.
Item didnt light up but my son loved the feel of it and wouldnt let me send it back
Not too good
A very good idea and my granddaughter loves it but only had a short while and it has broke, nylon zip has come apart and battery box kept falling out and wires came out so now doesn't work. Such a shame as it really comforted my 10yr autistic granddaughter.
Thought this was s waste of money  the lights are very small and it's not sensible to he white as it gets dirty very quickly  and difficult to wash would  not recommend this for anyone with sensory needs
Avoid this product no matter who is selling it. It is a white cushion with an ombr&eacute; of spots of light
The lights don't work
Item didn't work I havent received a replacement item or returns details.
I ordered this and received a laptop cushion not amused! Very disappointed!
The wire leading to the colour changing box came out , was unable to repair so there was no colour changing light at all, my grandaughter who is five was confused as she is autistic and kept taking the battery box out so I had to cut the second wire to remove the battery box for safety reasons.she still likes to cuddle it in bed but I was disapointed in it.She was born minus her ears therefore she is also deaf and particularly loves all pretty colours.
I have had this a month now. My son uses it every night. However, it was fantastic for about a week. Now only the red lights up, is very dim and I have to manually switch it off. New batteries make no difference. Very disappointed.
my son loved this when he got it but broke after a week. my son has autism and was very upset
Work for a day, and that's it. I won't recommend
Lasted about 2 weeks until the power unit inside broke apart. Avoid if you want it to last.
Poor quality , ordered 2 , one did not work . The cushions. Did not look like the photo. ,  that showed what they did look like when lit up .  Very disappointing. . I am sending them back ,
The product came, the box looked like it had already been opened and bashed around. Took the cushion out and placed batteries in it to find it does not work at all - the cushion is nice however could have been bought for Â£1 at a local shop. Not what I expected at all very disappointed
Poor
From the picture on the box this product looks fantastic but in reality it is something from The Fairground you win on the stalls.Talk about false advertising and tricking people. Once the batteries were in and light was out, the word pathetic comes to mind.Traffic lights are more amusing to watch change colours and they are better illuminated. Unless l had a faulty one which l dont think so as it was working, the best thing about this product is the box as at least the colours look good on the box unlike the product.
pillow never worked at all, very poor product.
IT IS NOT WORKING !!!
Had it only a week and the lights stopped working
Unfortunately i have to join the group of users that were disappointed by this product.The cushion is very fluffy and soft but the fist one I got worked 2 times 5min and that was it.I got a replacement and that 2nd cushion lasted 10min. Very disappointed.In both trials I changed the batteries but it didn't help and I couldn't see any damage with the wiring like other customers describe.I now got a refund so, the company is really easy to deal with. The product is a good idea but it is a shame that its quality is so poor.
Was already broken the 2nd day after we unwrapped it. My 9 year old son and me where very dissapointed. Rubbish.
Bought this as a Christmas present for my Grandson and was so disappointed as it  did not work. Electronics are very cheap looking. Will need to return this.
Was great , but didn't last long , wires broke very easy
Very poor. Doesnt light up like in the picture and stopped working very quickly.
Received this pillow and does not work! Received a replacement and neither did that one!!
Very poor after the first week one of the wire broke which I fixed now the switch does not work on the outside of the pillow very sad for 6 year old
Opened on Christmas Day, broken by Boxing Day! Not a good product
Rubbish!
I think I must have been sold a previously returned item.  Pillow was not in a plastic protective cover as should have been plus one side of pillow only 2 small colours light up.  Had my son not seen seen it, by accident, I would have returned it.  And it is not a pillow it is a cushion.
Zip broke off after a few days!! Quite disappointing!
Lights broke after 10 mins, cheap terrible product
Didn't last a week and it broke ,shame as it was to help my autistic daughter.
The first pillow arrived in good time but did not work. I returned it and had to wait two weeks for another one to arrive. Upon arrival I attempted to load new batteries. However, the battery cover has a short zip and the zip slider came off upon first opening rendering the pillow unusable. I have returned this pillow also and am still waiting for a full refund as at 13/12/2013
